  "description": "Trellis is a growing AgTech/IoT startup where we use wireless sensors to help users make better business decisions. A common feature in our applications is to display a list of sensors that shows a high level summary, but let users click on an individual sensor to view more information. This project is a small example of this typical use case. We want to understand your ability to read/understand an existing codebase, make design and architecture decisions, and develop a full stack application.",
